# Quantum Transformations (qt)

qt (pronounced "cutie") is a tool for performing depth-optimal layout synthesis of quantum circuits.

## Installation

qt depends on external tools such as planners and SAT solvers. To make usage easy, we have containerized the tool with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). To install the tool, simply open the repo in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension installed. The container will be built automatically and you will be able to use the tool from the terminal.

## Usage

Well, we need to write the tool first.
